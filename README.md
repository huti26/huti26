### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My main interest is Data Engineering. For that I work with a variety fields:

- Distributed Systems such as Apache Kafka or Spark.
- NoSQL Databases such as RocksDB.
- SQL Databases such as MySQL. For smaller projects I like working with SQLite.
- Statistics, which are required for general data visualizations. R (ggplot) is my prefered visualization framework, but I also like working with Seaborn in Python.
- Additionally, I use some ML frameworks (Mainly NLP related), where it is appropriate.

If you are curious about any of my repositories, there is a fair chance you can find some kind of write up about it on my [blog](https://huti26.github.io/).
