### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My main interest is Data Engineering. For that I work in a variety of fields:

- NoSQL Databases such as RocksDB.
- SQL Databases such as MySQL. For smaller projects, I like working with SQLite.
- Data Pipelines with Apache Beam (A unified framework by Apache, which allows users to run both Stream processing with Flink and Batch processing with Spark with the same code base)
- Statistics, which are required for general data visualizations. 
- R (ggplot) is my preferred visualization framework, but I also have experience working with Matplotlib/Seaborn and Plotly in Python.
- Additionally, I use some ML frameworks (Mainly NLP related), where it is appropriate.

If you are curious about any of my repositories, there is a fair chance you can find some kind of write-up about it on my [blog](https://huti26.github.io/).
